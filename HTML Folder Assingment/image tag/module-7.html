    <h1>Explore My Travel Gallery</h1>
    <p>
      Traveling has always been a passion of mine. Every place I visit adds a new layer to my memories.
      This gallery showcases some of the most breathtaking moments I’ve captured during my adventures.
      From the snow-kissed mountains to the calmness of a lakeside evening, each image tells a story of its own.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <span class="highlight">serene mountain</span> views remind me of early morning hikes,
      where the cold air is crisp and the scenery is untouched. The <span class="highlight">peaceful lake</span>
      image captures the stillness that makes you forget the chaos of the world.
      Nature has a beautiful way of grounding us.
    </p>

    <div class="gallery">
      <img src="./../assets/image2.jpg" alt="Mountain View" title="Serene Mountain">
      <img src="./../assets/image3.jpg" alt="Lake View" title="Peaceful Lake">
      <img src="./../assets/image5.jpg" alt="Forest Path" title="Lush Forest Path">
      <img src="./../assets/image6.jpg" alt="City Lights" title="Night City Vibes">
      <img src="./../assets/image7.jpg" alt="Beach" title="Sunny Beach">
      <img src="./../assets/image8.jpg" alt="Historic Site" title="Ancient Wonders">
    </div>

    <p>
      Walking through the <span class="highlight">forest paths</span>, I was surrounded by greenery, bird songs,
      and a deep sense of connection with the Earth. The <span class="highlight">city lights</span> brought out
      a contrasting vibe—buzzing, alive, and filled with stories of people living their dreams.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lastly, the <span class="highlight">beach sunsets</span> and <span class="highlight">historical ruins</span>
      were moments frozen in time. Whether it was listening to the waves crashing or imagining the past glory
      of ancient civilizations, each destination left a lasting impression on me.
    </p>

    <p>
      This gallery is not just a collection of pictures; it’s a journey. A journey through places, emotions, and memories.
      I hope it inspires you to pack your bags, pick up your camera, and start your own adventure.
